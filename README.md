# Programming-Task---Word-Search
## This is an interesting programming task.
It is realized with Depth First Search algorithm in a recursive way. 
Code annotation is also attached in the source code file.<br><br>
Due to time limit, the 2D board in this program is preset as the example matrix given in the exercise, which means users **can not** reset the 2D matrix arbitrarily. <br><br>
However, users **are able to** type in any word they hope to search for. The result is returned as boolean type (True or False/1 or 0). When the reture value is *True*, it shows that the word can be found in the 3x4 2D matrix in a consecutive way. Otherwise, the word can not be found when the return value is *false*.
